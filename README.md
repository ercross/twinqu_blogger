## Important Note
1. Aside showcasing my coding skills, the source code contained in this
project also showcases my preferred project architecture.
So you may encounter some empty directories while browsing through,
they are only there to illustrate the architecture.

2. Note also that though this app is built with implementing both iOS
Human Interface Design and Android Material Design, it is not guaranteed
that the app will run fine on an iOS device because I didn't have the time
to ensure this compatibility.
